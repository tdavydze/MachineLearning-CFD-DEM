# keras2cfd-dem
Using pretrained ANN to predict drag forces during runtime in CFD-DEM. The model can be trained on a fine mesh case and used to improve accuracy of coarse mesh modeling.
Base drag force models are:

Di Felice model (Di Felice, R. (1994). The voidage function for fluid-particle interaction systems. International Journal of Multiphase Flow, 20(1), 153-159.
