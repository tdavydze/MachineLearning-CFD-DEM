# MachineLearning-CFD-DEM

This repository provides an implementation for integrating pretrained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) into CFD-DEM simulations to predict drag forces during runtime. The approach enables high-fidelity modeling of fluid-particle interactions, leveraging machine learning to enhance the accuracy of coarse mesh simulations by learning from fine mesh data.

## Overview

Traditional CFD-DEM simulations rely on empirical drag models, such as Di Felice and Koch-Hill, which may not capture complex fluid-particle interactions at coarse resolutions. This codebase introduces a machine learning-assisted workflow, where ANNs trained on high-resolution data are used to predict drag forces, improving the physical fidelity of coarse-scale simulations.

The methodology and results are described in detail in our publication:

## Features

- **Runtime ANN Drag Prediction:** Integrates pretrained neural networks to predict drag forces for each particle during simulation.
- **Model Training Flexibility:** ANNs can be trained on fine mesh cases and deployed for coarse mesh modeling.
- **Base Drag Models:** Includes implementations of Di Felice and Koch-Hill drag laws for benchmarking and comparison.
- **OpenFOAM & LIGGGHTS Coupling:** Designed for use within the CFDEMproject framework, enabling coupled CFD-DEM simulations.
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Supports analysis of model uncertainty due to ANN initialization and training variability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/) (CFD solver)
- [LIGGGHTS](https://www.cfdem.com/liggghts-open-source-discrete-element-method-particle-simulation-code) (DEM solver)
- [CFDEMproject](https://github.com/CFDEMproject/CFDEMcoupling-PUBLIC) (CFD-DEM coupling)
- C++ compiler supporting C++14 or newer

### Installation

1. Clone this repository and place the drag model folders (`DiFeliceDrag_NN`, `KochHillDrag_NN`) into your CFDEMproject source tree.
2. Compile the code using the standard OpenFOAM wmake build system.

### Usage

- **Training:** Train your ANN model using high-resolution CFD-DEM data. Export the trained model in the required binary format.
- **Simulation:** Specify the ANN model file in your simulation dictionary. During runtime, the drag force for each particle will be predicted using the ANN.
- **Analysis:** Use the provided probe and output fields to analyze drag, velocity, collision force, and kinetic energy evolution.
